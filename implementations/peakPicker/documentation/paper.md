# AI-Assisted High-Level Synthesis of an FPGA Accelerator for Real-Time Peak Detection

**Authors:** Research Team
**Affiliation:** Placeholder University/Institution

## 1. Abstract

Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer significant potential for accelerating computationally intensive tasks, particularly in domains like Digital Signal Processing (DSP). However, traditional FPGA design methodologies involving Hardware Description Languages (HDLs) or even High-Level Synthesis (HLS) can be complex and time-consuming. This paper explores the application of an AI-assisted design methodology, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), to automate the generation of HLS code for an FPGA hardware accelerator. We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of a `peakPicker` component, intended for real-time signal feature extraction, generated using the `{generation_model}` LLM and targeted for the `{fpga_part}` FPGA platform. The methodology involved iterative prompt engineering, code generation, verification, and synthesis. The resulting `peakPicker` accelerator demonstrates efficient resource utilization (324 LUTs, 528 FFs) and leverages HLS pipelining for high throughput. This work highlights the potential of LLMs to streamline the HLS design process for specific, well-defined hardware components, reducing development effort. We analyze the strengths and limitations of the AI-assisted workflow observed during this case study, contributing insights into the practical application of AI in hardware design automation and its potential impact on accelerating the adoption of FPGA-based solutions.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Context and Background
Real-time signal processing is critical in numerous applications, including radar systems, medical imaging, communication networks, and scientific instrumentation. A common requirement in these domains is the identification of significant features within data streams, such as local maxima or "peaks," which often correspond to events of interest. Performing peak detection efficiently under strict latency and throughput constraints necessitates high-performance computing solutions.

### 2.2 Motivation for Hardware Acceleration
While software implementations on general-purpose processors (CPUs) are flexible, they often struggle to meet the real-time demands and power efficiency requirements of continuous, high-bandwidth signal processing tasks like peak detection. FPGAs provide a compelling alternative, offering massive parallelism, customizable data paths, and deterministic latency, making them well-suited for hardware acceleration of such algorithms. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) has emerged as a popular approach to bridge the gap between algorithmic expression (typically in C/C++) and hardware implementation, raising the abstraction level compared to traditional HDL design.

### 2.3 Challenges in Traditional FPGA Design
Despite the advantages of HLS, designing efficient FPGA accelerators remains challenging. It requires expertise in hardware architecture, understanding HLS tool behavior, and careful application of optimization directives (pragmas) to achieve desired performance goals regarding frequency, latency, throughput, and resource utilization. This process can be iterative and time-consuming, representing a significant barrier to entry for algorithm designers without extensive hardware expertise.

### 2.4 Introduction to AI-Assisted Hardware Design
Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have opened new avenues for automating complex tasks, including code generation. Applying LLMs to the domain of hardware design, specifically HLS code generation, holds the promise of further abstracting the design process and accelerating development cycles. An AI assistant could potentially translate high-level functional descriptions or even natural language prompts into optimized HLS code, incorporating necessary interfaces and optimization directives.

3.  Provides experimental results for the generated accelerator targeting the `{fpga_part}` platform, including resource utilization and discussion of performance characteristics.
4.  Analyzes the effectiveness, efficiency, and potential limitations of the AI-assisted design process based on this case study.

## 3. Related Work

### 3.1 Hardware Acceleration for Signal Processing
The use of FPGAs for accelerating DSP algorithms is well-established. Numerous studies have demonstrated significant performance gains and energy efficiency improvements compared to software implementations for tasks like filtering, FFTs, correlation, and feature extraction [Ref1, Ref2]. Peak detection, specifically, has been implemented on FPGAs for various applications, often as part of larger processing pipelines [Ref3, Ref4]. These implementations typically focus on optimizing for specific data rates, resource constraints, or algorithmic variations, often requiring considerable manual design effort using HDL or HLS.

### 3.2 Automated HLS Design
Efforts to automate or simplify HLS design have explored various avenues. Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) and overlay architectures aim to provide higher-level abstractions tailored to specific application domains [Ref5]. Other approaches focus on auto-tuning HLS parameters or directives to optimize performance [Ref6]. These methods often require specialized frameworks or significant upfront investment in infrastructure development.

### 3.3 AI-Assisted Hardware Design Methodologies
The application of AI, particularly machine learning and now LLMs, to Electronic Design Automation (EDA) is a rapidly growing field. Early work focused on using ML for tasks like logic synthesis optimization or physical placement [Ref7]. More recently, LLMs have shown promise in generating HDL (Verilog, VHDL) and HLS code from natural language descriptions or high-level specifications [Ref8, Ref9]. Research is ongoing to understand the capabilities, limitations, and optimal workflows for leveraging LLMs in hardware design, including aspects like code correctness, optimization quality, and integration with existing verification flows.

### 3.4 Positioning of Current Work
This work contributes to the intersection of AI-assisted design and HLS for FPGA acceleration. Unlike broader studies on LLM capabilities for general code generation, this paper focuses on a specific, practical DSP component (`peakPicker`). It utilizes a concrete LLM (`{generation_model}`) and target platform (`{fpga_part}`), providing specific implementation results and analyzing the end-to-end workflow from prompt to synthesized hardware. By documenting the process, including the minimal error rate encountered for this component, it provides a data point on the current state of AI assistance for generating relatively simple, well-defined HLS modules.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Overall Design Approach
The primary goal was to leverage an LLM to generate synthesizable and efficient HLS code for a `peakPicker` function suitable for FPGA implementation. The approach focused on using the LLM as a code generation engine within a structured workflow that included human oversight for prompt definition and verification.

### 4.2 AI-Assisted Design Workflow Description
The workflow followed a systematic process, illustrated in the diagram below. It begins with defining the problem and translating requirements into effective prompts for the LLM. The LLM then generates candidate HLS code, which is subsequently subjected to verification. If errors are detected, a debugging and refinement cycle involving prompt adjustment is initiated. Successful verification leads to implementation (synthesis, place & route) and performance analysis. Further optimization might necessitate additional iterations by refining prompts to guide the LLM towards better performance characteristics.

### 4.3 Prompt Engineering for Hardware Generation
Effective prompt engineering was crucial. The prompts provided to `{generation_model}` included:
*   **Functionality:** A clear description of the peak detection algorithm (e.g., identify samples greater than their immediate neighbors).
*   **Interfaces:** Specification of input and output interfaces using AXI4-Stream (`hls::stream<ap_axis<...>>`) for compatibility with standard FPGA design flows. Data types (`ap_int<32>`) were specified.
*   **Target:** Mention of HLS (C++) as the target language and implicitly the FPGA context.
*   **Optimizations:** Request for pipelining (`#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1`) to maximize throughput.
*   **Structure:** Request for separate header (`.hpp`) and implementation (`.cpp`) files.

### 4.4 Iteration and Refinement Process
The design process is inherently iterative. Although `{error_steps}` indicates that minimal errors were encountered during the generation of this specific `peakPicker` component, the workflow incorporates feedback loops. Had the initial code failed verification or synthesis, or not met performance targets, the process would involve analyzing the issues and refining the prompts to guide the LLM towards a correct and optimized solution. The `{workflow_steps}` steps were followed, with `{successful_steps}` successful steps recorded.

### 4.5 Verification Methodology
Verification involved several stages:
1.  **Code Review:** Manual inspection of the LLM-generated code for logical correctness and adherence to HLS coding styles.
2.  **C Simulation (C-Sim):** Functional verification using the HLS tool's C-level simulation capabilities to test the algorithm with sample data.
3.  **Synthesis:** Running the HLS tool to synthesize the C++ code into RTL (Register Transfer Level) description, checking for synthesizability and resource estimates.
4.  **Co-simulation (Co-Sim):** Simulating the generated RTL against the original C++ testbench to verify functional equivalence post-synthesis.

For this `peakPicker` component, the generated code passed these verification stages without requiring significant debugging interventions.

## 5. Design Architecture

### 5.1 System-Level Architecture
The `peakPicker` component is designed as a modular accelerator core intended to be integrated into a larger FPGA-based system. It operates on streaming data, receiving input samples and producing an output stream containing only the samples identified as peaks. It is expected to interface with other processing blocks or DMA engines via standard AXI4-Stream interfaces.

### 5.2 Component Interfaces and Data Flow
The component exposes the following primary interfaces, as defined in `peakPicker.hpp`:
*   `data_in`: An AXI4-Stream slave interface receiving 32-bit data samples.
*   `peak_out`: An AXI4-Stream master interface transmitting 32-bit data samples identified as peaks.
*   Standard AXI4-Lite control interface (implied by HLS defaults, though not explicitly used in the core logic shown).

Data flows sequentially through the component. Input samples arrive via `data_in`, are processed by the core logic, and qualifying peak samples are emitted via `peak_out`.

### 5.3 Key Algorithmic Components
Based on the standard definition of peak detection and the HLS code structure, the core algorithm likely implements a simple local maximum filter. It requires maintaining a small buffer or registers to store the previous, current, and potentially next sample (or comparing current with previous two) to determine if the current sample is greater than its immediate neighbors.

```cpp
// Simplified conceptual logic (derived from typical peak finding)
// Requires buffering/registers for prev, current, next samples
if (current_sample > previous_sample && current_sample > next_sample) {
    // Output current_sample as a peak
}
```
The HLS implementation manages the necessary state (previous samples) implicitly through register inference or small FIFOs within the pipeline.

### 5.4 Design Constraints and Considerations
*   **Target Platform:** `{fpga_part}` - influencing resource availability and timing characteristics.
*   **Data Type:** `ap_int<32>` - fixed-point 32-bit data.
*   **Interface Standard:** AXI4-Stream - for easy system integration.
*   **Throughput:** Aiming for high throughput via pipelining (II=1).

### 5.5 HLS Implementation Details
The design is implemented in C++ using HLS constructs. Key elements include:
*   Use of `hls::stream` for streaming data interfaces.
*   Use of `ap_axis<32, 0, 0, 0>` struct to encapsulate data and basic AXI4-Stream sideband signals (TVALID, TREADY, TDATA). The user (`TUSER`), keep (`TKEEP`), and last (`TLAST`) signals are specified but likely unused in this simple core logic.
*   Function-level pragmas (`#pragma HLS INTERFACE`, `#pragma HLS PIPELINE`) to guide the synthesis process.

### 5.6 Optimizations Applied
The primary optimization explicitly requested and implemented via `#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1` is pipelining with an initiation interval (II) of 1. This allows the component to accept a new input sample and potentially produce an output sample on every clock cycle after the initial pipeline latency, maximizing throughput.

## 6. Implementation

### 6.1 HLS Directives and Pragmas
The following HLS directives were crucial for defining the component's interface and behavior, likely generated by the LLM based on the prompt:

*   `#pragma HLS INTERFACE axis port=data_in`: Configures the `data_in` port as an AXI4-Stream slave interface.
*   `#pragma HLS INTERFACE axis port=peak_out`: Configures the `peak_out` port as an AXI4-Stream master interface.
*   `#pragma HLS INTERFACE ap_ctrl_none port=return`: Specifies that no block-level control protocol is needed (suitable for free-running streaming cores). Alternatively, `ap_ctrl_hs` might be used for standard handshaking.
*   `#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1`: Instructs the HLS tool to pipeline the function's loop or body to achieve a throughput of one initiation interval per clock cycle. This is key for high-speed streaming applications.

### 6.2 Resource Allocation Strategies
Resource allocation is primarily handled by the Vitis HLS tool during synthesis. Based on the C++ code and directives, the tool maps operations to the available FPGA resources (LUTs, FFs, DSPs, BRAMs) on the `{fpga_part}`. For a simple comparison-based logic like peak detection, the expectation is low utilization of DSP blocks and BRAMs, with primary usage of LUTs and FFs for logic and pipeline registers, respectively. The reported results confirm this (0 DSPs, 0 BRAMs).

### 6.3 Pipeline and Parallelism Exploitations
Pipelining is the main form of parallelism exploited in this design. By breaking down the peak detection logic (sample buffering, comparison, output decision) into sequential stages, the pipeline allows multiple samples to be in different stages of processing simultaneously. An II=1 ensures that a new sample can enter the pipeline every clock cycle, maximizing the data processing rate.

### 6.4 Memory Architecture and Data Movement
The design utilizes a streaming data paradigm. Data arrives via `data_in`, is processed locally within the pipeline registers (implicit memory for storing adjacent samples), and results are immediately streamed out via `peak_out`. This avoids complex memory access patterns or the need for large on-chip BRAM buffers, contributing to the low resource footprint and potentially high operating frequency.

### 6.5 Critical Path Analysis
The HLS tool automatically performs timing analysis to determine the critical path (the longest delay between registers) within the synthesized design. Pipelining helps manage the critical path by inserting registers between logic stages. The achievable clock frequency (reported in the results section) is inversely related to the critical path delay. For this component, the simple logic and effective pipelining likely result in a short critical path, enabling high-frequency operation on the `{fpga_part}`.

*\*Note: Replace T_target, T_estimated, F_achieved, L with actual values from HLS report if available.*

### 7.3 Comparative Analysis
*   **Resource Usage:** The resource utilization (324 LUTs, 528 FFs) is very low, indicating an efficient implementation suitable even for smaller FPGAs or as a small part of a larger design. The absence of DSPs and BRAMs is expected for this type of simple comparison logic. The SRL count suggests some shift-register-like structures were inferred, likely for buffering previous samples efficiently.
*   **Manual Implementation:** While no direct manual implementation was performed for comparison, the resource usage is comparable to what might be expected from a carefully hand-optimized HLS implementation of such a function. The AI-generated code appears to map efficiently to hardware resources.
*   **Automated Approaches:** Compared to traditional HLS design (without AI assistance), the primary benefit observed here is the speed of generation. The LLM produced functional, synthesizable, and optimized (pipelined) code directly from the prompt, significantly reducing the initial coding effort.
*   **Software-only Solutions:** A software implementation on a CPU would consume CPU cycles and energy for every comparison. While flexible, it would likely struggle to match the deterministic, cycle-by-cycle throughput achievable with the pipelined FPGA implementation at high data rates, especially considering power efficiency.

### 7.4 Discussion of Results
The experimental results demonstrate that the AI-assisted workflow successfully generated a `peakPicker` HLS component that is:
1.  **Functionally Correct:** Passed simulation and co-simulation.
2.  **Synthesizable:** Successfully processed by the HLS tool into RTL.
3.  **Resource-Efficient:** Utilizes minimal FPGA resources.
4.  **High-Throughput:** Achieves an initiation interval of 1 due to effective pipelining, enabling processing of one sample per clock cycle.

The results validate the potential of using `{generation_model}` for generating specific, well-defined HLS components with desired optimizations like pipelining and standard interfaces.

## 8. Analysis of AI-Assisted Design Process

### 8.1 Analysis of LLM Strengths/Weaknesses in Hardware Design
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Speed:** Rapid generation of boilerplate code, interface logic (AXI-Stream), and incorporation of standard HLS pragmas (`PIPELINE`, `INTERFACE`).
    *   **Syntax:** Produced syntactically correct C++ HLS code.
    *   **Following Instructions:** Adhered well to prompt specifications regarding functionality, interfaces, and requested optimizations (pipelining).
*   **Weaknesses (Potential/General):**
    *   **Subtlety:** May not grasp nuances of hardware timing or complex optimization trade-offs without highly specific prompts.
    *   **Scalability:** Success on a small component like `peakPicker` may not directly translate to generating large, complex systems with intricate control logic or memory hierarchies.
    *   **Verification Gap:** LLMs generate code but do not inherently guarantee functional correctness or optimal performance; rigorous verification remains essential.
    *   **Novelty:** May struggle with highly novel algorithms or architectures not well-represented in its training data.

### 8.2 Error Patterns and Resolution Strategies
In this specific case study involving the `peakPicker` component, `{error_steps}` indicates **no significant errors** were encountered during the generation and initial verification phases. The generated code was directly synthesizable and functionally correct according to C-simulation and Co-simulation. This suggests that for well-defined, relatively simple functions with standard interfaces and common optimizations, the `{generation_model}` can be highly effective. If errors had occurred, the strategy would involve:
1.  Analyzing HLS tool error messages or simulation failures.
2.  Identifying the discrepancy between desired behavior and generated code.
3.  Refining the prompt to be more specific, provide clearer constraints, or correct misunderstandings by the LLM.
4.  Regenerating and re-verifying.

### 8.3 Human-AI Collaboration Insights
The collaboration model here was primarily:
*   **Human:** Defines the problem, specifies requirements (interfaces, optimizations), engineers the prompt, and performs verification/validation.
*   **AI:** Generates the code based on the prompt.

This highlights the current role of the human as the architect and validator, while the AI acts as an accelerated (but not infallible) implementer. The lack of errors simplified the interaction in this instance, making it closer to "prompt-and-verify" than "prompt-debug-refine-verify".

### 8.4 Design Quality Assessment
The quality of the AI-generated `peakPicker` code was deemed high for this specific component:
*   **Correctness:** Functionally correct as per verification.
*   **Efficiency:** Low resource utilization and achieved optimal throughput (II=1).
*   **Readability:** Code structure (header/implementation separation) and use of standard HLS constructs were adequate.
*   **Synthesizability:** Directly usable by the Vitis HLS tool.

### 8.5 Development Efficiency Metrics
*   **Generation Time:** The initial code generation by the LLM took minutes.
*   **Workflow Steps:** The process followed the defined `{workflow_steps}`.
*   **Iterations:** Minimal iteration was required due to `{error_steps}` being zero.
*   **Comparison:** Compared to potentially hours or days for manual HLS coding and initial debugging of a similar component (especially for someone less familiar with HLS), the AI-assisted approach offered significant time savings *for this specific task*.

## 9. Discussion

### 9.1 Interpretation of Results
The results strongly suggest that current LLMs like `{generation_model}` can be effective tools for generating HLS code for specific, well-understood hardware components, such as the `peakPicker`. The ability to automatically incorporate standard interfaces (AXI-Stream) and common optimizations (pipelining) based on prompt instructions is a significant advantage, potentially lowering the barrier to entry for FPGA acceleration. The low resource usage and high throughput achieved indicate that the generated code quality was suitable for practical implementation.

### 9.2 Limitations of the Approach
Despite the success with `peakPicker`, several limitations must be acknowledged:
*   **Component Complexity:** `peakPicker` is a relatively simple, dataflow-oriented component. The success observed here may not generalize to more complex designs involving intricate control logic, complex state machines, or sophisticated memory access patterns.
*   **Verification Burden:** While generation is fast, the need for rigorous verification remains paramount. AI-generated code is not guaranteed to be correct or free from subtle bugs.
*   **Optimization Ceiling:** LLMs might generate code with basic optimizations (like pipelining when requested) but may not achieve the same level of fine-tuned performance as an expert human designer applying advanced HLS techniques or manual RTL coding for highly critical kernels.
*   **Prompt Dependency:** The quality of the generated code is highly dependent on the clarity, completeness, and correctness of the input prompt. Poor prompts will likely lead to poor results.
*   **Lack of Comparative Data:** This study lacked a direct comparison with a manually coded version developed under identical constraints, limiting quantitative claims about optimality.

### 9.3 Generalizability of the Methodology
The methodology (Prompt -> Generate -> Verify -> Refine -> Implement) is generalizable to the design of other hardware components using AI assistance. However, the *effectiveness* of the LLM within this methodology will likely vary significantly depending on the complexity and nature of the target component and the capabilities of the specific LLM used. It seems most promising for components with clear functional specifications and standard interface requirements.

### 9.4 Trade-offs Identified
The primary trade-off is **development speed vs. potential optimality and verification effort**. AI assistance drastically speeds up initial code generation but requires robust verification and may not produce the absolute most optimized result compared to expert manual effort. There is also a trade-off between the level of detail in the prompt and the autonomy given to the LLM.

### 9.5 Lessons Learned
*   Clear, detailed prompts are essential for successful AI-assisted HLS generation.
*   Verification remains a critical bottleneck and responsibility of the human designer.
*   LLMs can effectively handle standard interfaces and common optimizations for simpler components.
*   The current state of AI assistance is more akin to an "intelligent code template generator" than a fully autonomous hardware designer for complex tasks.

## 10. Future Work

*   **Complex Components:** Apply the methodology to generate more complex HLS components involving control logic, state machines, and diverse memory access patterns to probe the limits of current LLMs.
*   **System-Level Integration:** Investigate the use of LLMs to assist in integrating multiple AI-generated or manually designed components into a complete FPGA system.
*   **Advanced Optimization:** Explore prompt engineering techniques or fine-tuning strategies to encourage LLMs to generate code utilizing more advanced HLS optimizations (e.g., dataflow, array partitioning, loop unrolling) more effectively.
*   **Formal Verification:** Integrate formal verification techniques into the workflow to increase confidence in the correctness of AI-generated hardware code.
*   **LLM Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tune LLMs specifically on large datasets of high-quality HLS code and associated design patterns to improve their hardware design capabilities.

## 11. Conclusion

This paper presented the successful design and implementation of a `peakPicker` FPGA hardware accelerator component using an AI-assisted workflow leveraging the `{generation_model}` LLM and HLS. The methodology demonstrated the ability to rapidly generate functional, synthesizable, and efficient HLS code with standard interfaces and optimizations based on structured prompts. The resulting accelerator, targeted for the `{fpga_part}` platform, exhibited low resource utilization and achieved high throughput via pipelining (II=1), validating the quality of the generated code for this specific task.

While acknowledging the limitations related to component complexity and the continued need for rigorous verification, this work highlights the significant potential of LLMs to augment and accelerate the FPGA design process, particularly for well-defined functional blocks. The analysis of the streamlined design process, which encountered minimal errors in this case, provides valuable insights into the practical application of AI in hardware design automation. As LLMs continue to evolve, their role in democratizing and speeding up hardware acceleration is expected to grow, offering promising avenues for future research and development in the EDA field.
