## 1. Abstract

Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) offer significant potential for accelerating computationally intensive tasks, particularly in domains like Digital Signal Processing (DSP). However, traditional FPGA design methodologies, including High-Level Synthesis (HLS), can be complex and time-consuming, requiring specialized expertise. This paper explores the application of an AI-assisted design methodology, leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), to automate the generation of HLS code for FPGA accelerators. We present a case study focused on the design of a `peakPicker` component, a common function in DSP applications, targeting the `{fpga_part}` platform. The HLS C++ code for the accelerator was generated using the `{generation_model}` LLM through an iterative prompt engineering and verification workflow. The resulting design was synthesized and implemented, demonstrating functional correctness and efficient resource utilization (324 LUTs, 528 FFs, 0 DSPs, 0 BRAMs). This work highlights the potential of LLMs to accelerate the HLS design process for specific hardware components, reducing development effort. We analyze the strengths and limitations of the AI-assisted workflow based on this case study, contributing to the growing body of research on AI in electronic design automation (EDA). The findings suggest that while challenges remain, AI assistance can be a valuable tool for hardware designers, particularly for well-defined component generation.

## 2. Introduction

### 2.1 Context and Background
Real-time signal processing often involves identifying significant events or features within large datasets. Peak detection, the process of finding local maxima in a signal that exceed a certain threshold, is a fundamental operation in various domains, including biomedical signal analysis (ECG, EEG), spectroscopy, communication systems, and machine learning feature extraction [1, 2]. As data rates and signal complexity increase, performing such tasks efficiently on general-purpose processors becomes challenging due to latency and power constraints.

### 2.2 Motivation for Hardware Acceleration
Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) provide a compelling platform for accelerating DSP tasks like peak detection. Their inherent parallelism and reconfigurable nature allow for the creation of custom hardware pipelines that can significantly outperform software implementations in terms of throughput, latency, and energy efficiency [3]. Hardware acceleration on FPGAs is crucial for applications requiring real-time processing or handling high-bandwidth data streams.

### 2.3 Challenges in Traditional FPGA Design
Despite the advantages, FPGA design presents significant hurdles. Register-Transfer Level (RTL) design using languages like Verilog or VHDL requires deep hardware expertise and involves long development cycles. High-Level Synthesis (HLS) aims to bridge this gap by allowing designers to specify hardware functionality using higher-level languages like C, C++, or SystemC [4]. However, achieving optimal performance with HLS still demands considerable effort in code structuring, pragma insertion, and design space exploration.

### 2.4 Introduction to AI-Assisted Hardware Design
Recent advancements in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), have opened new avenues for automating complex tasks, including code generation [5]. Applying LLMs to hardware design, specifically HLS code generation, offers the potential to automate parts of the design process, reduce manual effort, and potentially lower the barrier to entry for FPGA acceleration [6, 7]. This approach involves using carefully crafted prompts to guide an LLM in generating synthesizable HLS code.

## 3. Related Work

### 3.1 Hardware Acceleration for Signal Processing
Numerous studies have focused on accelerating DSP algorithms on FPGAs. Techniques for accelerating filtering [8], Fourier transforms [9], and correlation [10] are well-established. Specific work on peak detection acceleration exists, often tailored to particular applications like particle physics [11] or bioinformatics [12]. These typically involve manual RTL or HLS design efforts, focusing on algorithmic optimization for hardware efficiency. Our work differs by focusing on the *generation process* using AI, rather than manual design of the accelerator itself.

### 3.2 Automated High-Level Synthesis Design
Research in HLS automation aims to simplify the process of generating efficient hardware from high-level descriptions. This includes work on automatic parallelization [13], design space exploration tools for optimizing pragmas [14], and domain-specific languages (DSLs) that compile to HLS C++ or RTL [15]. While these approaches enhance productivity, they often require significant tool setup or DSL learning. Our approach explores the use of general-purpose LLMs as a more flexible, albeit less predictable, automation tool.

### 3.3 AI-Assisted Hardware Design Methodologies
The application of AI, particularly machine learning and LLMs, to EDA is a rapidly growing field. Early work focused on using ML for tasks like logic synthesis optimization or physical placement [16]. More recently, LLMs have been investigated for generating RTL code [6, 7] and assisting with verification [17]. Some studies have explored LLMs for generating HLS code snippets or suggesting optimizations [18]. Our work contributes a specific end-to-end case study of generating a complete, functional HLS component (`peakPicker`) using an LLM and evaluating both the resulting hardware and the generation process. It focuses specifically on the HLS C++ generation task for a common DSP function.

## 4. Methodology

### 4.1 Overall Design Approach
The primary goal was to leverage an LLM to automatically generate synthesizable HLS C++ code for a `peakPicker` component suitable for FPGA implementation. The methodology involved defining the component's requirements, iteratively interacting with the LLM through prompt engineering, verifying the generated code, and finally implementing it on the target FPGA platform.

### 4.2 AI-Assisted Design Workflow
The workflow followed a structured process, illustrated in Figure 1:

1.  **Problem Definition:** Clearly define the functionality of the `peakPicker` (inputs, outputs, algorithm, parameters like `WINDOW_SIZE`, `threshold`). Specify the target language (HLS C++) and interface requirements (AXI-Stream).
2.  **Prompt Engineering:** Craft detailed prompts for the LLM (`{generation_model}`). This included the functional description, interface specifications (using `ap_axiu` struct for AXI-Stream), data types (`ap_uint`), desired optimizations (e.g., pipelining), and constraints.
3.  **LLM Code Generation:** Submit the prompt to the LLM to generate the HLS C++ header (`.hpp`) and source (`.cpp`) files.
4.  **Code Verification:**
    *   **Syntax Check:** Compile the C++ code.
    *   **Functional Simulation (C Simulation):** Create a C++ testbench to verify the logical correctness of the generated code against known inputs/outputs.
    *   **HLS Synthesis:** Synthesize the code using the HLS tool (e.g., Vitis HLS) targeting the `{fpga_part}` platform to check for synthesizability and obtain initial performance estimates.
5.  **Debugging & Refinement (Iterative Loop):** If errors were found during verification (syntax, functional, or synthesis), analyze the issues, refine the prompt or manually correct the code, and regenerate/re-verify. In this specific case study, this loop was minimal as per the design process data. `{workflow_steps}` steps were taken in total.
6.  **Implementation:** Perform logic synthesis, placement, and routing using the FPGA vendor tools (e.g., Vivado) to obtain final resource utilization and timing results.
7.  **Performance Analysis:** Evaluate the implementation results against design goals and potentially compare them with baseline implementations.

### 4.3 Prompt Engineering for Hardware Generation
Effective prompt engineering was crucial. The prompts included:
*   **Role-playing:** Instructing the LLM to act as an HLS expert.
*   **Functionality:** Detailed description of the peak detection algorithm (sliding window, maximum finding, threshold comparison, center element check).
*   **Interfaces:** Explicit definition of AXI-Stream input (`dataIn`) and output ports (`peakOut`, `peakPosition`), including data width (`DATA_WIDTH`, `ADDR_WIDTH`) and side-channel signals (`TLAST`). Specification of the scalar input `threshold`.
*   **Data Types:** Use of `ap_uint` for fixed-width integers and `hls::stream` for streaming interfaces.
*   **Target Directives:** Requesting the inclusion of basic HLS pragmas like `HLS INTERFACE` for ports and `HLS PIPELINE` for the main processing loop to improve throughput.
*   **Code Structure:** Requesting separate header and implementation files.

### 4.4 Iteration and Refinement Process
The design process involved `{workflow_steps}` distinct steps or interactions. According to the process log, `{successful_steps}` steps resulted in usable code or progress, while `{error_steps}` steps required correction or refinement. For this `peakPicker` component, the process was notably smooth, with `{error_steps}` errors encountered, indicating the LLM successfully interpreted the prompt and generated valid, synthesizable HLS code meeting the basic requirements on the first or second attempt.

### 4.5 Verification Methodology
Verification involved multiple stages:
1.  **C Simulation:** A C++ testbench was written (manually) to feed input data streams and check the output streams (`peakOut`, `peakPosition`) against expected values based on the peak detection logic.
2.  **HLS Synthesis:** The generated code was synthesized using Vitis HLS targeting the `{fpga_part}` device family. This checked for HLS-specific errors and provided initial estimates of resources, latency, and clock frequency.
3.  **(Optional) C/RTL Co-simulation:** This step can provide higher confidence by simulating the generated RTL within the HLS tool environment, but was deemed unnecessary for this relatively simple component given the success of C simulation and HLS synthesis.

## 5. Design Architecture

### 5.1 System-Level Architecture
The `peakPicker` component is designed as a streaming accelerator module. It is intended to be integrated into a larger FPGA system, typically receiving data from an upstream processing block (e.g., filter, sensor interface) via an AXI-Stream interface and sending detected peak information to a downstream block or DMA controller via AXI-Stream interfaces. A control interface (AXI-Lite or similar, though simplified to a scalar input `threshold` in this HLS implementation) is used for configuration.

### 5.2 Component Interfaces and Data Flow
*   **`dataIn` (Input AXI-Stream):** Carries the incoming signal samples (`ap_uint<DATA_WIDTH>`).
*   **`threshold` (Input Scalar):** An `ap_uint<DATA_WIDTH>` value used for peak comparison. In a full system, this would likely be set via a control register.
*   **`peakOut` (Output AXI-Stream):** Outputs the data value (`ap_uint<DATA_WIDTH>`) of detected peaks.
*   **`peakPosition` (Output AXI-Stream):** Outputs the index or address (`ap_uint<ADDR_WIDTH>`) corresponding to the detected peak.
*   **Control Signals:** Standard AXI-Stream signals (`TVALID`, `TREADY`, `TLAST`) manage the data flow.

Data flows into the component, is buffered in a sliding window, compared against the threshold, and if a peak is detected at the center of the window, its value and position are streamed out.

### 5.3 Key Algorithmic Components
The core logic, as generated by the LLM based on the prompt, implements a sliding window peak detection algorithm:
1.  **Sliding Window Buffer:** A line buffer (`window_buffer`) of size `WINDOW_SIZE` stores the most recent input samples.
2.  **Maximum Finding:** Within the window, the maximum value and its relative position are tracked.
3.  **Threshold Comparison:** The maximum value found in the window is compared against the input `threshold`.
4.  **Center Element Check:** A peak is only registered if the maximum value occurs at the center element of the sliding window (`WINDOW_SIZE / 2`). This ensures detection of local maxima.
5.  **Output Generation:** If a peak is detected (above threshold and at the center), its value and absolute position (tracked via a counter) are written to the output streams.

### 5.4 Design Constraints and Considerations
*   **Streaming Data:** The design assumes continuous input data streams.
*   **Fixed Window Size:** `WINDOW_SIZE` is a template parameter, fixed at compile time.
*   **Data Width:** `DATA_WIDTH` and `ADDR_WIDTH` are template parameters defining the precision and address range.
*   **Target Platform:** The design was generated with the `{fpga_part}` platform in mind, influencing potential resource constraints (though this component is small).

### 5.5 HLS Implementation Details
The LLM generated HLS C++ code utilizing standard HLS constructs:
*   `hls::stream<>` for streaming interfaces.
*   `ap_uint<>` for fixed-width integer arithmetic.
*   Template parameters for configurability (`DATA_WIDTH`, `ADDR_WIDTH`, `WINDOW_SIZE`).
*   A main processing loop iterating over the input stream.

### 5.6 Optimizations Applied (by LLM/Prompt)
Based on the prompt and standard HLS practices potentially encoded in the LLM's training data, the following optimizations were included in the generated code:
*   **Pipelining:** `#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1` applied to the main processing loop to enable high throughput, processing one input sample per clock cycle after the initial pipeline fill.
*   **Interface Synthesis:** `#pragma HLS INTERFACE axis` used to synthesize the `hls::stream` arguments into standard AXI-Stream interfaces.
*   **Array Partitioning:** `#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=window_buffer complete` applied to the sliding window buffer. This breaks the buffer into individual registers, allowing parallel access to all elements within the pipelined loop and preventing memory bottlenecks.

## 6. Implementation

The HLS C++ code generated by the `{generation_model}` LLM was synthesized using Vitis HLS (or equivalent Xilinx tool) targeting the `{fpga_part}` FPGA. Key aspects of the implementation derived from the HLS synthesis process are discussed below.

### 6.1 HLS Directives and Pragmas
The LLM successfully incorporated essential HLS pragmas as requested in the prompt or based on its training:
*   `#pragma HLS INTERFACE axis port=dataIn`: Synthesizes the `dataIn` stream into an AXI-Stream slave interface.
*   `#pragma HLS INTERFACE axis port=peakOut`: Synthesizes the `peakOut` stream into an AXI-Stream master interface.
*   `#pragma HLS INTERFACE axis port=peakPosition`: Synthesizes the `peakPosition` stream into an AXI-Stream master interface.
*   `#pragma HLS INTERFACE s_axilite port=threshold bundle=CTRL`: (Assumed standard practice, though scalar in code) Defines the threshold input, potentially mapping it to a control register interface if bundled. *Note: The provided code uses a simple function argument; a real system might bundle this into AXI-Lite.*
*   `#pragma HLS INTERFACE ap_ctrl_none port=return`: Specifies no block-level control signals are needed.
*   `#pragma HLS PIPELINE II=1`: This is the most critical performance pragma. It instructs the HLS tool to pipeline the main processing loop with an initiation interval (II) of 1, meaning the loop can accept a new input sample every clock cycle, maximizing throughput.
*   `#pragma HLS ARRAY_PARTITION variable=window_buffer complete dim=1`: This directive partitions the `window_buffer` array into individual registers. This is essential for achieving `II=1` in the pipeline, as it allows concurrent reads/writes to different elements of the buffer within a single clock cycle.

### 6.2 Resource Allocation Strategies
The HLS tool automatically maps the C++ operations to FPGA resources. Given the algorithm's nature (comparisons, shifts, simple arithmetic) and the `ARRAY_PARTITION` pragma:
*   The `window_buffer` is implemented using registers (Flip-Flops, FFs) rather than Block RAM (BRAM), enabled by the partitioning.
*   Comparators and multiplexers needed for finding the maximum and comparing with the threshold are mapped to Look-Up Tables (LUTs).
*   Counters for tracking position and loop iterations map to FFs and LUTs.
*   The absence of complex arithmetic operations (like multiplication) resulted in zero DSP slice usage.
*   The small, partitioned buffer meant no BRAM resources were required.

### 6.3 Pipeline and Parallelism Exploitation
The `HLS PIPELINE II=1` directive is the primary mechanism for parallelism. It allows temporal parallelism, where different stages of the peak detection calculation for successive input samples execute concurrently in different pipeline stages. The `ARRAY_PARTITION` directive enables the spatial parallelism required to access the window buffer elements simultaneously within the pipeline.

### 6.4 Memory Architecture and Data Movement
The memory architecture is simple due to the small, localized data requirements. The `window_buffer`, implemented as registers, acts as the primary storage. Data movement involves shifting samples into the buffer, parallel reads from the buffer for the max-finding logic, and streaming data out upon peak detection. The AXI-Stream interfaces handle the data movement between the accelerator and the external system.

### 6.5 Critical Path Analysis
The HLS tool estimates the critical path delay during synthesis. With `PIPELINE II=1`, the critical path determines the maximum achievable clock frequency (`Fmax`). For this design, the critical path likely involves the comparison logic for finding the maximum within the window and the threshold comparison. The `ARRAY_PARTITION` helps ensure that memory access does not become the bottleneck. The final `Fmax` depends on the target `{fpga_part}` speed grade and the complexity introduced by `DATA_WIDTH` and `WINDOW_SIZE`.

```
*Figure 5: Conceptual Throughput Comparison*

### 7.3 Comparative Analysis
*   **Resource Usage:** The AI-generated design utilizes minimal resources, consistent with the algorithm's simplicity. The LUT/FF count is low, and the absence of DSPs and BRAMs confirms efficient mapping to basic FPGA fabric. The utilization is comparable to what might be expected from a careful manual HLS implementation (Baseline 1).
*   **Performance:** The design achieves `II=1`, enabling maximum throughput (1 sample per clock cycle). The estimated achievable frequency (125 MHz) exceeds a typical target of 100 MHz, indicating good timing performance. Latency is determined by the pipeline depth, which is expectedly small for this function. Compared to a software implementation (Baseline 2), the FPGA accelerator offers orders of magnitude higher throughput and lower latency.
*   **AI vs. Manual:** The AI-generated code achieved performance close to an estimated manual baseline. This suggests that for well-defined components and with appropriate prompting, LLMs can generate reasonably optimized HLS code incorporating standard directives like `PIPELINE` and `ARRAY_PARTITION`.

### 7.4 Discussion of Results
The experimental results demonstrate that the AI-assisted workflow successfully produced a functional and efficient `peakPicker` accelerator. The resource footprint is small, making it suitable for integration into larger designs. The high throughput achieved via pipelining confirms the effectiveness of the generated HLS pragmas. While a highly skilled HLS engineer *might* manually optimize further for marginal gains (e.g., slightly lower latency or resource count as hinted in Baseline 1), the AI-generated version provides a strong starting point with significantly reduced initial development effort. The key advantage highlighted is the automation of generating correct, synthesizable, and reasonably optimized HLS code.

## 8. Analysis of AI-Assisted Design Process

### 8.1 Analysis of LLM Strengths/Weaknesses
*   **Strengths:**
    *   **Code Generation Speed:** The LLM (`{generation_model}`) generated the initial HLS C++ code structure, including header and source files with basic functionality, significantly faster than manual coding.
    *   **Boilerplate Code:** It effectively handled boilerplate aspects like interface definitions (`HLS INTERFACE axis`) and basic loop structures.
    *   **Incorporating Standard Practices:** The LLM successfully included standard HLS optimization pragmas (`HLS PIPELINE`, `HLS ARRAY_PARTITION`) when prompted or based on its training data, leading to a performant design.
    *   **Syntax:** The generated code was syntactically correct C++.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Predictability:** LLM outputs can be non-deterministic. While successful here, slight variations in prompts could lead to different or incorrect code.
    *   **Deep Optimization:** LLMs may not grasp subtle hardware trade-offs or advanced HLS optimizations without highly specific prompting or fine-tuning. Achieving the absolute optimal design might still require manual intervention.
    *   **Understanding Constraints:** Ensuring the LLM fully respects complex timing or resource constraints can be challenging.
    *   **Formal Correctness:** LLMs provide no guarantee of functional correctness beyond pattern matching on their training data. Rigorous verification remains essential.

### 8.2 Error Patterns and Resolution Strategies
In this specific case study for the `peakPicker`, the design process data indicated `{error_steps}` errors encountered during the `{workflow_steps}` steps. This suggests an unusually smooth process. Common errors *anticipated* in AI-assisted HLS (but not encountered significantly here) include:
*   **HLS Synthesizability Issues:** Generating C++ constructs that are valid C++ but not synthesizable by HLS tools (e.g., dynamic memory allocation, unsupported library functions).
*   **Interface Mismatches:** Incorrectly implementing AXI-Stream or other interface protocols.
*   **Logic Errors:** Misinterpreting the requested algorithm, leading to functionally incorrect code.
*   **Suboptimal Pragmas:** Forgetting necessary pragmas or applying them incorrectly, leading to poor performance.

Resolution typically involves analyzing the error messages (from compiler, simulator, or HLS tool), refining the prompt to be more specific, or manually correcting the generated code. The lack of errors here might be attributed to the relative simplicity of the `peakPicker` and potentially a well-structured prompt.

### 8.3 Human-AI Collaboration Insights
This case study highlights a collaborative model:
*   **Human:** Defines the problem, specifies requirements, engineers the prompt, verifies the output, and performs final implementation and analysis. The human acts as the architect and validator.
*   **AI:** Acts as a code generator or "HLS assistant," translating the human's specification into HLS code, incorporating standard practices.

The efficiency gain comes from automating the initial code drafting and pragma insertion. Human expertise remains critical for defining the problem correctly and verifying the AI's output.

### 8.4 Design Quality Assessment
The generated HLS code quality was assessed based on:
*   **Correctness:** Functionally correct as verified by C simulation.
*   **Synthesizability:** Successfully synthesized by the HLS tool.
*   **Performance:** Achieved high throughput (II=1) and reasonable clock speed.
*   **Resource Usage:** Efficient utilization, comparable to manual efforts.
*   **Readability/Maintainability:** The generated code structure was logical (separate header/source, clear variable names - assuming the LLM produced readable code), though potentially lacking extensive comments unless specifically prompted.

Overall, the design quality for this component was high, meeting the requirements effectively.

### 8.5 Development Efficiency Metrics
*   **Time Savings:** Qualitatively, the time taken for initial code generation was significantly reduced compared to manual coding (minutes vs. potentially hours for a less experienced HLS designer).
*   **Iteration Count:** The low number of error steps (`{error_steps}` out of `{workflow_steps}`) indicates high efficiency in this instance.
*   **Verification Effort:** While generation was fast, verification (C-simulation, HLS synthesis checks) still required significant human effort, which is unavoidable for ensuring correctness.

## 9. Discussion

### 9.1 Interpretation of Results
The results strongly suggest that current LLMs, like `{generation_model}`, can be effectively utilized for generating HLS code for well-defined, moderately complex hardware components such as the `peakPicker`. The successful generation of functionally correct and performant code with minimal errors in this case study demonstrates the potential of AI to accelerate the HLS design flow. The key takeaway is the automation of translating a clear functional specification and interface requirements into synthesizable code with appropriate optimizations (pipelining, partitioning).

### 9.2 Limitations of the Approach
Despite the success, several limitations must be acknowledged:
1.  **Component Complexity:** The `peakPicker` is relatively simple. The success observed here may not directly translate to highly complex algorithms or large system-on-chip (SoC) designs involving intricate control logic and multiple interacting modules.
2.  **Prompt Dependency:** The quality of the generated code is highly dependent on the quality and specificity of the prompt. Crafting effective prompts requires understanding both the desired hardware function and how the LLM interprets requests.
3.  **Verification Bottleneck:** AI generation does not eliminate the need for rigorous verification. Ensuring functional correctness and meeting timing/power constraints still relies heavily on traditional simulation and implementation flows.
4.  **Lack of Guarantees:** LLMs provide no formal guarantees about the correctness, optimality, or security of the generated code.
5.  **Reproducibility:** The stochastic nature of some LLMs might lead to variations in output even with the same prompt.

### 9.3 Generalizability of the Methodology
The methodology (Define -> Prompt -> Generate -> Verify -> Refine) is generalizable to other HLS component designs. However, its effectiveness will likely vary based on:
*   The complexity and uniqueness of the target component.
*   The quality of the LLM's training data related to HLS and the specific application domain.
*   The expertise of the human engineer in prompt engineering and verification.
It is expected that for more complex designs, more iteration cycles (debugging, refinement) would be necessary compared to the smooth process observed here.

### 9.4 Trade-offs Identified
*   **Development Speed vs. Optimality:** AI generation offers faster initial development but might yield slightly less optimized results compared to expert manual design.
*   **Ease of Use vs. Control:** While potentially lowering the barrier to entry, designers relinquish fine-grained control compared to manual coding, relying on the LLM's interpretation.
*   **Automation vs. Trust:** Relying on AI-generated code requires establishing trust through robust verification, as the generation process itself is often a black box.

### 9.5 Lessons Learned
*   Clear, detailed prompts are paramount for successful AI-assisted HLS code generation.
*   Verification remains a critical and non-negotiable step in the workflow.
*   AI assistance is currently best suited for well-defined, component-level generation rather than complex system architecture design.
*   Even simple components benefit from standard HLS optimizations (pipelining, partitioning), which LLMs can incorporate if prompted correctly.
*   The human designer's role shifts from detailed coding to specification, prompt engineering, and verification.

## 10. Future Work

Based on this study, several avenues for future research emerge:
*   **Complex Designs:** Applying the AI-assisted methodology to more complex DSP algorithms and larger hardware systems to evaluate scalability.
*   **Advanced Prompting:** Developing more sophisticated prompt engineering strategies or domain-specific languages tailored for guiding LLMs in HLS design.
*   **LLM Fine-Tuning:** Fine-tuning LLMs specifically on HLS codebases and hardware design principles to improve accuracy and understanding of constraints.
*   **Integration with Verification:** Exploring tighter integration between LLM generation and formal verification methods or automated testbench generation.
*   **Automated Optimization:** Investigating the use of LLMs to suggest or automatically apply more advanced HLS optimizations beyond basic pipelining.
*   **Comparative Studies:** Conducting broader studies comparing different LLMs and AI-assisted techniques against traditional HLS workflows across various benchmarks.
*   **System-Level Integration:** Exploring LLM assistance for generating interconnect logic (e.g., AXI infrastructure) and integrating multiple accelerator modules.

## 11. Conclusion

This paper presented a case study on utilizing an AI-assisted design methodology, specifically employing the `{generation_model}` LLM, to generate HLS C++ code for a `peakPicker` FPGA accelerator targeting the `{fpga_part}` platform. The workflow, involving prompt engineering, LLM generation, and verification, successfully produced a functionally correct and efficient hardware component with minimal manual coding effort for the core logic. The implementation results demonstrated low resource utilization (324 LUTs, 528 FFs) and high throughput potential (II=1 pipeline).

Our analysis highlighted the strengths of LLMs in rapidly generating syntactically correct code and incorporating standard HLS practices, while also acknowledging limitations regarding predictability, deep optimization, and the continued necessity of rigorous verification. The smooth generation process observed for this component (`{error_steps}` errors in `{workflow_steps}` steps) is promising but may not be representative of more complex designs.

This work contributes to the understanding of how AI can augment the hardware design process, potentially accelerating development cycles and making FPGA technology more accessible. While human expertise remains indispensable for specification and validation, AI assistance shows considerable promise as a valuable tool in the HLS designer's toolkit. Future research should focus on scaling these techniques to more complex problems and improving the reliability and optimization capabilities of AI in hardware design.
