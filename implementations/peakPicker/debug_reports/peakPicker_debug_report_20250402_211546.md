```

## LLM Analysis and Suggestions (gemini-2.0-pro-exp)
Okay, let's break down the error and the code.

**1. Analysis of the Error Message**

```
ERROR: Mismatch between NUM_SEQUENCES (3) and columns read from pssCorrMagSq_3_in.txt (1)
ERR: [SIM 100] 'csim_design' failed: nonzero return value.
```

*   **`ERROR: Mismatch between NUM_SEQUENCES (3) and columns read from pssCorrMagSq_3_in.txt (1)`**: This is the crucial message. It originates from your test bench (`peakPicker_tb.cpp`).
    *   You have defined `NUM_SEQUENCES` as `3` in `peakPicker.hpp`.
    *   Your test bench reads the input file `pssCorrMagSq_3_in.txt` using the `readMatrixFromFile` function.
    *   This function determined that the file `pssCorrMagSq_3_in.txt` contains only **1** column of data per row.
    *   The test bench has a validation check:
        ```cpp
        // In peakPicker_tb.cpp, inside main()
        if (numXcorrCols != NUM_SEQUENCES) {
            std::cerr << "ERROR: Mismatch between NUM_SEQUENCES (" << NUM_SEQUENCES
                      << ") and columns read from " << XCORR_IN_FILE << " (" << numXcorrCols << ")" << std::endl;
            return 1; // <-- This causes the non-zero return value
        }
        ```
    *   Since `numXcorrCols` (1) is not equal to `NUM_SEQUENCES` (3), this error message is printed, and the `main` function returns `1`.

*   **`ERR: [SIM 100] 'csim_design' failed: nonzero return value.`**: This is the HLS tool reporting that the C simulation executable (which is compiled from your `peakPicker.cpp`, `peakPicker_tb.cpp`, and potentially other files) exited with an error code (specifically, the `return 1;` from the test bench).

**Root Cause:** The primary problem is **not** in the HLS core logic (`peakPicker.cpp`) itself, but in the **input data file** (`pssCorrMagSq_3_in.txt`) used by the test bench. The test bench expects this file to have 3 columns of data per line (matching `NUM_SEQUENCES`), but it only found 1 column per line.

**2. Examination of Source Code**

*   **`peakPicker.hpp`**: Defines `NUM_SEQUENCES = 3`. This dictates the size of the `hls::vector<Data_t, NUM_SEQUENCES>` used for `InputSample_t`.
*   **`peakPicker.cpp`**: The HLS function correctly uses `NUM_SEQUENCES` in loops (`CHECK_SEQUENCES_LOOP`) and expects `InputSample_t` (which is a vector of size 3) from the input streams. The logic seems consistent with `NUM_SEQUENCES = 3`.
*   **`peakPicker_tb.cpp`**:
    *   The `readMatrixFromFile` function correctly reads the file line by line and uses `std::getline(ss, cell, '\t')` to split the line into columns based on the **tab character (`\t`)** as a delimiter. It counts the columns found (`currentCol`) and checks for consistency.
    *   The `main` function correctly calls `readMatrixFromFile` and performs the validation check that triggers the error.

**Conclusion from Code Examination:** The C++ code (both DUT and test bench) appears consistent with the definition of `NUM_SEQUENCES = 3`. The test bench logic for reading the file and validating its dimensions against `NUM_SEQUENCES` is working as intended â€“ it has correctly identified an inconsistency in the input data file.

**3. Suggested Fixes**

The fix involves correcting the input data file, not the C++ code itself (unless the delimiter is wrong).

**Primary Fix: Correct the Input Data File**

1.  **Open the file `pssCorrMagSq_3_in.txt`** in a text editor that clearly shows whitespace characters (like tabs).
2.  **Verify the Format:** Ensure that each line in the file contains exactly **three** numerical values.
3.  **Verify the Delimiter:** Ensure that these three values on each line are separated by a **tab character (`\t`)**, not spaces or commas.

    *   **Incorrect (Space delimited, 1 column detected per line if spaces aren't the delimiter):**
        ```
        1.23 4.56 7.89
        0.12 3.45 6.78
        ...
        ```
    *   **Incorrect (Comma delimited, 1 column detected per line if comma isn't the delimiter):**
        ```
        1.23,4.56,7.89
        0.12,3.45,6.78
        ...
        ```
    *   **Correct (Tab delimited, 3 columns detected):**
        ```
        1.23<TAB>4.56<TAB>7.89
        0.12<TAB>3.45<TAB>6.78
        ...
        ```
        *(Where `<TAB>` represents an actual tab character)*

4.  **Save** the corrected file.
5.  **Re-run C Simulation:** Execute `csim_design` again.

**Secondary Check (Less Likely): Delimiter Mismatch**

*   If you are *certain* the file `pssCorrMagSq_3_in.txt` uses a different delimiter (e.g., spaces or commas) instead of tabs, you would need to modify the `readMatrixFromFile` function in `peakPicker_tb.cpp`:

    ```cpp
    // Inside readMatrixFromFile in peakPicker_tb.cpp
    // Change '\t' to the correct delimiter, e.g., ' ' for space or ',' for comma
    while (std::getline(ss, cell, '\t')) { // <-- CHANGE '\t' if needed
         try {
            rowVec.push_back(std::stof(cell));
            currentCol++;
        } catch (...) { // ... existing error handling ...
           return false;
        }
    }
    ```
    *However, the error message "columns read ... (1)" suggests the current delimiter (`\t`) is likely *not* matching whatever separates the numbers if there are indeed multiple numbers per line, causing the whole line to be read as a single column.* Correcting the file to use tabs is generally the better approach if the MATLAB `writematrix` default was intended.

**4. Explanation**

The HLS C simulation runs your test bench (`peakPicker_tb.cpp`) which calls your HLS design (`peakPicker`). The test bench is responsible for providing stimulus (input data) and checking the results.

Your test bench includes essential validation steps to ensure the input data it reads from files matches the parameters defined for the HLS design (like `NUM_SEQUENCES`). This is good practice.

In this case, the validation check `if (numXcorrCols != NUM_SEQUENCES)` failed because the number of columns found in `pssCorrMagSq_3_in.txt` (1) did not match the expected number based on your HLS design's configuration (`NUM_SEQUENCES = 3`). The test bench correctly reported this inconsistency and terminated with an error code, causing the overall C simulation to fail.

By correcting the format of `pssCorrMagSq_3_in.txt` to have 3 tab-separated columns per line, you align the test bench's input data with the expectations of both the test bench validation logic and the HLS `peakPicker` function, allowing the simulation to proceed past the file reading/validation stage.
