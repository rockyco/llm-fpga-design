Check if the test now reports PASSED or FAILED based on the corrected comparison logic.\n    *   **If `csim_design` still fails with `[SIM 100]`:** The crash is due to a different reason. Examine the `csim.log` file (usually found in the `<solution>/csim/build/` directory) for more detailed error messages (e.g., segmentation fault location, specific assertion failures). Further debugging would involve simplifying the input data, adding debug prints (`std::cout`) in the DUT (use sparingly and remove for synthesis), or checking the HLS tool environment.\n    *   Ensure the input files (`pssCorrMagSq_3_in.txt`, `threshold_in.txt`, `locations_3_ref.txt`) exist in the expected location relative to where the simulation is run (usually `<project>/<solution>/csim/build/`).",
