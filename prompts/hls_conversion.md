# Copilot Instructions for Peak Picker Implementation

## Project Context
This project implements a critical component of a 5G NR SSB detection application. 
The peak picker algorithm identifies SSB signals by locating peaks where the 
magnitude squared of the PSS correlation (`xcorr`) exceeds a predefined threshold.

## Task Description
Your task is to translate the MATLAB peak picker algorithm into efficient HLS C++ 
code while preserving exact functionality. The implementation should be optimized 
for FPGA deployment using Xilinx HLS directives.
