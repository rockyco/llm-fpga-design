ðŸ”¥ **Exciting Breakthrough: Revolutionizing FPGA Design with LLMs** ðŸ”¥

The integration of LLM APIs has elevated FPGA design productivity to new heights. I'm thrilled to share my latest work developing an LLM-Aided FPGA Design Flow that automates code generation from MATLAB to HLS and streamlines simulation error debugging!

The most exciting part? It leverages Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro API, which is currently **FREE** to access! ðŸ¤¯

What this workflow does:
âœ… Automatically converts MATLAB reference code to optimized HLS C++
âœ… Intelligently debugs simulation errors with detailed fix suggestions
âœ… Streamlines the entire development process from algorithm to hardware

My tests show this approach reduces development time by 60%-70% while maintaining high-quality implementations. The ability of Gemini 2.5 Pro to understand complex hardware concepts and generate correctly structured HLS code is truly remarkable.

If you're working with FPGAs or interested in hardware acceleration, I'd be happy to share more details. This could transform how we approach hardware design in the age of AI!

ðŸ”„ Just updated our "LLM-Based HLS Code Generation and Debugging Workflow" visualization in our llm-fpga-design project!

After your amazing feedback yesterday, I've enhanced the workflow diagram to better illustrate how we're using LLMs like Claude, GPT-4, and Gemini to revolutionize FPGA design processes. The updated graph now clearly shows:

âœ… Complete end-to-end flow from MATLAB algorithms to optimized HLS implementations
âœ… Detailed AI-powered debugging pipeline with automated error analysis
âœ… Model selection logic between different LLM providers
âœ… Integration points between AI assistance and traditional HLS tools

This approach has dramatically reduced our development time while maintaining high-quality designs. We're seeing particularly strong results in our 5G NR peak picker case study.

# Introducing LLM-FPGA-Design: AI-Powered FPGA Development Framework

I'm excited to share our latest project from the University of Technology Sydney: an innovative framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to revolutionize FPGA design workflows.

## ðŸ”§ What It Does
This framework automates the FPGA design process by using AI to:
- Convert MATLAB algorithm descriptions directly to optimized HLS C++ code
- Intelligently debug compilation and simulation errors
- Apply performance optimizations automatically
- Generate comprehensive documentation and research papers

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Specialized LLM agents for code generation, debugging, optimization, and documentation
- **Model Flexibility**: Compatible with OpenAI (GPT-4), Google (Gemini), and Anthropic (Claude) models
- **Automated Workflow**: End-to-end orchestration from algorithm to synthesis and implementation
- **Interactive CLI**: User-friendly command interface for controlling the design process

## ðŸš€ Benefits
- Dramatically reduces development time from weeks to hours
- Makes FPGA design more accessible to software engineers
- Enables rapid prototyping of complex signal processing algorithms
- Preserves design knowledge through comprehensive auto-generated documentation

This project represents a significant step toward democratizing FPGA development through AI assistance. Interested in trying it or collaborating? Let's connect!
