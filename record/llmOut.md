DEBUG ASSISTANT SUGGESTIONS
================================================================================

Okay, let's debug this HLS C++ code.

## Debug Analysis

1.  **Error Message Analysis:**
    *   `ERR: [SIM 100] 'csim_design' failed: nonzero return value.` This is a general error indicating that the C simulation process terminated unexpectedly or returned an error code.
    *   `Test FAILED: Output does not match reference.` This is the key piece of information. It tells us that the C++ code, when compiled and run as a standard C/C++ program (which `csim_design` does), produces results (`locations` array and `numLocations`) that differ from the expected "golden" results provided by your testbench. This strongly suggests a **functional bug** in the C++ algorithm's logic itself, rather than an HLS-specific synthesis or timing issue at this stage.

2.  **Source Code Examination:**
    *   **Overall Logic:** The code iterates through the `xcorr` data using a sliding window. For each window position, it identifies a `candidateLocation` at the window's center. It checks if any sequence's value at this location exceeds the corresponding `threshold`. If yes, it then checks if this `candidateLocation` holds the maximum value within the window for *all* the sequences that exceeded the threshold.
    *   **Potential Issue Area:** Let's look closely at the condition for adding a peak location:
        ```c++
        // If threshold is exceeded, check if candidate is maximum in window
        if (thresholdExceeded) {
            int maxCheckCount = 0;

            VALID_SEQ_LOOP:
            for (int v = 0; v < validSeqCount; v++) {
                // ... (checks if candidate is max for sequence validSeqIndices[v])
                if (isMax) {
                    maxCheckCount++; // Incremented if candidate is max for this sequence
                }
            }

            // If candidate is maximum in window for all valid sequences, add to peak locations
            if (maxCheckCount == windowLength) { // <--- SUSPICIOUS CONDITION
                locations[numLocations] = candidateLocation;
                numLocations++;
                // ... (buffer overflow check)
            }
        }
        ```
    *   **Logical Flaw:** The variable `maxCheckCount` counts how many of the *valid sequences* (those exceeding the threshold at `candidateLocation`) also have their maximum value within the window at `candidateLocation`. The condition `if (maxCheckCount == windowLength)` compares this count to the `windowLength`. This doesn't seem logically correct based on the likely intent. The intent is probably to confirm that the `candidateLocation` is the maximum for *all* sequences that initially exceeded the threshold at that point. Therefore, `maxCheckCount` should be compared against `validSeqCount` (the number of sequences that exceeded the threshold).

3.  **Other Considerations:**
    *   **Array Indexing:** The indexing seems generally correct (`candidateLocation`, `index + w`). Bounds checks appear reasonable.
    *   **Data Types:** `DataType` is used consistently. Assuming it's defined correctly (e.g., `float`, `double`, or a fixed-point type) in `peakPicker.hpp`.
    *   **Pragmas:**
        *   `INTERFACE` pragmas define how the function interacts with the outside world (AXI buses). These don't affect the core C simulation logic's correctness but are crucial for synthesis.
        *   `ARRAY_PARTITION`: Partitioning `xcorr` on dimension 2 (sequences) is good for parallelism, allowing simultaneous access to different sequences' data. This shouldn't cause a *functional* error in `csim`.
        *   `PIPELINE`: These optimize loop throughput during synthesis. The `PIPELINE` inside `WINDOW_CHECK` might be aggressive if `windowLength` is large, but it shouldn't cause the `csim` functional mismatch. The one on `SLIDE_WINDOW` is standard.
    *   **Initialization:** `numLocations`, `thresholdExceeded`, `validSeqCount`, `maxCheckCount`, `isMax` seem correctly initialized within their scopes.

## Suggested Code Changes

The primary issue identified is the condition used to confirm a peak location.

**Change this line:**

```c++
            // If candidate is maximum in window for all valid sequences, add to peak locations
            if (maxCheckCount == windowLength) {
```

**To this:**

```c++
            // If candidate is maximum in window for all valid sequences, add to peak locations
            if (maxCheckCount == validSeqCount) {
```

## Explanation of Fix

*   **Original Logic:** The code checked if the number of sequences for which the candidate was the maximum (`maxCheckCount`) was equal to the size of the window (`windowLength`). This comparison is arbitrary and doesn't reflect the requirement that the peak must be maximal for *all relevant sequences*. For example, if `validSeqCount` was 3 but `windowLength` was 5, the peak would never be added even if it was the maximum for all 3 valid sequences. Conversely, if `validSeqCount` was 5 and `windowLength` was 3, the condition could potentially be met incorrectly.
*   **Corrected Logic:** The corrected code checks if `maxCheckCount` (the number of sequences where the candidate is the maximum within the window) is equal to `validSeqCount` (the total number of sequences that exceeded the threshold at the candidate location). This correctly implements the logic: "A location is a peak only if it exceeds the threshold *and* is the maximum value within the window for *every single sequence* that exceeded the threshold at that location."

This change directly addresses the logical flaw identified and should resolve the mismatch between the simulation output and the reference data, assuming the reference data was generated based on this corrected logic.
